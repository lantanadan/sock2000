PNG - Raster image format, editable in Photoshop, Paint, GIMP, etc.
SVG - Vector image format, editable in Illustrator, Krita, Inkscape, etc.

These templates are open source and you may use them in your own projects or for any purpose, if you desire. However, you may also edit them and submit them back for inclusion in SOCK S#?&!ER 2000. Lantana Games reserves the right to refuse any design for inclusion. This means your designs may not be included in the game, but if they are you will be credited for your work. Your designs may be used in marketing materials for the game, including but not limited to graphics, videos, screenshots, or promotional materials, but will not be used as merchandise.

All designs will be available at all qualities: Ratty, Everyday, Sporty, Athletic, Business, Fancy, and Cozy. Lantana Games is under no obligation to include Steam Community Market or alternative monetization methods with the game. Should we, however, the monetary value of socks may increase with their quality. Socks will not be directly purchaseable but will generate by playing the game. The minimum price for all socks will be $0.03 USD and maximum price shall be determined by the community. Should your designs be accepted into the game and a monetization system such as Steam Community Market be available, you will receive 60% revenue share on your sock designs on a quarterly basis. If you do not supply a payment method - such as Paypal or Stripe - within 30 days of owed payment, or if previously agreed upon, Lantana Games will donate your last month's revenue share to The Odd Sock (https://theoddsock.org/).
